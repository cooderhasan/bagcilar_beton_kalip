                "content": "Choosing the right concrete formwork plays a critical role in the success of a construction project. The right formwork system both reduces costs and speeds up construction. When choosing between wall, column or slab formworks, you must consider the static requirements of your project and labor capabilities. Steel formworks provide long life and smooth surfaces, while plywood systems offer lightness and flexibility."

                "content": "Steel formwork systems are indispensable especially in highly repetitive projects and where high surface quality is desired. Steel systems, which are much more durable than wooden formworks, maintain their form even after hundreds of castings. Also, thanks to the ease of assembly and disassembly, they significantly reduce labor costs. In terms of sustainability, steel formworks are an environmentally friendly option as they are recyclable."

                "content": "Safety comes first in high-rise construction. Climbing formwork systems provide both a safe working platform and protection against external factors such as wind. These systems speed up the construction process by minimizing crane usage. Formworks equipped with railing systems and wind screens to protect workers against the risk of falling should be preferred."
